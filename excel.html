<p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he definition of public art is being redefined in unique ways across the country. In this story, we explore one of those ways via longtime NEA grantee, Focus: HOPE, and their ambitious youth development initiative, Excel Photography. For years, the Excel Photography program has educated and empowered middle-school students through the art of documenting how they see Detroit. This free, semester-long program culminates with a proper gallery exhibition of their images and, in years past, by enlarging and mounting the students’ photography on abandoned buildings in blighted neighborhoods as public artworks.
</p>
<p>
This year, instead of posting youth-shot pictures on abandoned buildings, select images will be projected as temporary public art onto the Bell Building downtown during Focus: HOPE’s inaugural photography festival on September 15, 2018. For a day, the work of students will be presented alongside that of professional photographers.
</p>
<p>
In this audio piece, we talked with one of those students participating in the Bell Building exhibit, seventh-grader DonRico Hawkins, Jr., and Kristian Varano, a former graduate of the program (2006-2008) and now a mentor herself, about the Excel Photography program and its impact.
</p>
<p>
In the 30 years since, that small clean-up program has bloomed into Mural Arts Philadelphia: part city agency, part nonprofit, and longtime NEA grantee. Through the organization’s work, the city itself has bloomed with thousands of murals and other public artworks. Murals run the gamut of styles, sizes, and messages, from the colorful dreamscape of How to Turn Anything into Something Else, a collaboration between the artist collective Miss Rockaway Armada and local schoolchildren; to Legacy, which was partially completed by incarcerated men using portable materials; to a mural honoring the late 60 Minutes journalist Ed Bradley, a Philadelphia native son. On the sides of restaurants, above community gardens, and in countless parking lots, the murals celebrate Philadelphia’s neighborhoods and the power of community.
