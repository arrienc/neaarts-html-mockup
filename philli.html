From the first hospital established in 1732 to the first meeting of the U.S. Congress in 1789 to the first zoo opened in 1847, Philadelphia has long been a city of national firsts. According to a 2007 New York Magazine article, the City of Brotherly Love was also the birthplace of modern graffiti, with the earliest examples appearing there in the 1960s. Fast forward to the 1980s, by which time graffiti had spread to many urban centers across the U.S., prompting politicians to react punitively toward both the graffiti itself and its makers. 
</p>
<p>
Wilson Goode, Philadelphia’s first African-American mayor, took office in January 1984. Not surprisingly, among his many campaign promises was a pledge to reduce the city’s graffiti blight. What made Goode’s solution exceptional, however, was that he saw an opportunity to empower the youth of his city by harnessing the outlaw energy of their graffiti writing to fuel mural projects aimed at beautifying the city. 
</p>
<p>
To that end, Goode authorized a small program, then known as the Anti-Graffiti Network, tapping a young artist named Jane Golden to run it. “I suddenly had to very quickly think about, ‘Why are young people writing on walls? And how do we create a program that is not punitive, that’s supportive, and can help achieve the mayor’s mission, which is to make Philadelphia a more beautiful city?’” recalled Golden, who had previous experience working with murals on the West Coast. 
</p>
<p>
In the 30 years since, that small clean-up program has bloomed into Mural Arts Philadelphia: part city agency, part nonprofit, and longtime NEA grantee. Through the organization’s work, the city itself has bloomed with thousands of murals and other public artworks. Murals run the gamut of styles, sizes, and messages, from the colorful dreamscape of How to Turn Anything into Something Else, a collaboration between the artist collective Miss Rockaway Armada and local schoolchildren; to Legacy, which was partially completed by incarcerated men using portable materials; to a mural honoring the late 60 Minutes journalist Ed Bradley, a Philadelphia native son. On the sides of restaurants, above community gardens, and in countless parking lots, the murals celebrate Philadelphia’s neighborhoods and the power of community.
